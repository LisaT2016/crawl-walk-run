## Algorithms
- Based on prob stats?
- Different types of problems have tuned Algorithms
| Problem | Strategy | Parameters and Return Type |
| ------- | -------- | -------------------------- |
| Predict continuous values | Linear Regression | P: feature data, training rate R: label |
| Image Recognition | ??? | ??? |
| ??? | ??? | ??? |
